# Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Personality Quiz Online

## About

PMD quiz online is a litte project I did in my spare time because I love PMD and I always wanted to do this. I did it once in Unity but I didn't like the result so I decided to do it again in HTML5 using Svelte, TailwindCSS and Vite as a bundler. This was the framework a friend of mine recommended me and I really liked it. 

I have no idea of what I'm doing (well, I have some), I'm not a web developer, this is my second frontend project, the first one was a simple sign up form to get used to this.

Code is kind of a mess, it works, there are no bugs (that I know) and it works fine. If you want to check the code of this repo as inspiration... Please don't, give me sometime to clean it up.

If you have any question you can contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rionisguild) or open an issue on this repo.

## Assets used

I tried using the original assets ripped from the game to be as faithful as possible to the game while still adapting it a little to fit these times.

Althought not all assets are mine, here are the sources:

- [Font](https://www.dafont.com/es/wonder-mail.font)
- [Questions and Natures [ES]](https://www.wikidex.net/wiki/Test_de_personalidad_de_Pokémon_Mundo_misterioso:_Exploradores_del_cielo)
- [Questions [EN] (ripped from html)](https://explorerofsky.github.io/pmd-sky-quiz/)
  - The points were wrong, now I use another source (check update below)
- [Natures [EN]](https://www.deviantart.com/sparklespeed/journal/Pokemon-Mystery-Dungeon-EoS-Nature-Descriptions-439788647)
- Sprites were ripped from the game
- Sounds were ripped from the game

  - These were thanks to Palika on SkyTemple Discord. I modified them to make the transition in the browser seamless.
